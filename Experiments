The algorithm below is used to determine the efficient multiplication of two matrices.  As one can see result[0] is the
correct computation for Ax = x*y in the index A[0][0].  The same goes for result[1] as well.  I have determined
the issue deals with lack of computation with the inner product space, which is viewed more deeply within Hessenberg deflations
and QR algorithms.  My next decision would be to implement a while loop to iterate over each list and change from ranges to
enumeration of one np.array made into a list.

>>> result = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0])
>>> for i in range(0, 2):
...     for j in range(0, 2):
...             result[i] += listx[i][j]*listy[j][i]
... 
>>> result
array([19, 50,  0,  0])
>>>
