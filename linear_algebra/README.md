# Linear Algebra Portfolio

    The main idea for this is to understand pythonic implementation for the underlying math for linear algebra.

    Future additions:
        Hessenberg Deflations
        QR Algorithms
        Gauss Seidel Method

### How to review

    first:
       
        $ git clone https://github.com/phos-tou-kosmou/linear_algebra
       

    next: 
      
       $ chmod +x transposition
       
       
       $ python3 ./transposition
       

    There should be a default function being tested while running the script;
    however, it is a small library implementation so import it and test out the functions


These are rigorous excercises because I enjoy Linear Algebra and am interested in memory coalescing.
