### Soft-Phone

I currently have an example of a soft-phone, which is utilizing a demo with the Twilio API.  Currently the phone can place calls and send text messages.  The number must contain the country code and is solely created for the USA code of 1.

This project has allowed me to learn flask and how it deals with routes.  I would like to take the API for a note taking app such as evernote and implement that into the memo button, which is currently unavailable.  On top of this integration an address book and automated cyclic calling would allow sales team to be much more efficient with their time.
