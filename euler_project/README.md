# ProjectEuler.net problems

    If you have never heard of project Euler then you are in for a treat.  
    It is a collection of math problems that you get to turn into programming!! Isn't this great!

    The most common language, I would believe to be python although the site is language agnostic.  
    Honestly, you could use Matlab or even a calculator to solve the problems.  
    However, they turn out to be fantastic programming excercises that work more on 
    where to cache and how to read lists and perform efficient list comprehension (python).

### If you would like to run these files

    first: 
        `git clone https://github.com/phos-tou-kosmou/python_portfolio/euler_project`

    then:
        `$ cd euler_project`
        `$ chmod +x multiples_of_three_and_five`
        `$ python3 multiples_of_three_and_five`

    Note: The example above applies to all file within this directory
    just make sure to chmod and then run the correct file. 
    Alternatively, you could use python 2.7 
    and the inputs for the multiples in multiples_of_three_and_five.py are unlimited.  Go crazy!
